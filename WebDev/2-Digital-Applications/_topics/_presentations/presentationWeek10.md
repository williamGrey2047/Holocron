# Assessment Documentation

[Assessment 2 Information](WebDev/2-Digital-Applications/2024S2/assessment2-2024S2.md)
- This document has been fully updated to include scaffolds for each section of the assessment. It should serve as a guide to make writing your assessment easy and carefree.
- Still start as early as you can (it should have been started already)
- There are only 3 weeks left (not including school holidays) until assessments are due. Ensure you are on track to hand in. A good point to be is that at the end of this week 2 of the sections have been completely written.

- Find screenshots of evidence for each task in the VET Competency document on Google Classroom.
- Edit the screenshots with circles and arrows to point directly at what is being proven where necessary.
- Tag Ryan in the sections title **Client Only** when you believe you have completed them in the project so that he can check those and give you credit for it.
