Python is a popular and powerful programming language used for a wide range of applications. Here's a summary of its key features:

  

**General-purpose:** It can be used for various tasks, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

**Beginner-friendly:** Its syntax is clear and concise, making it easier to learn compared to other languages.

**Interpreted:** You don't need to compile code before running it, speeding up development and debugging.

**Object-oriented:** It supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects, allowing for modular and organized code.

**Extensive libraries:** It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various tasks, reducing the need to write everything from scratch.

**Large community:** It boasts a large and active community of users and developers, providing support and resources.

  

Here are some specific examples of what Python can be used for:

  

- **Web development:** Frameworks like Django and Flask simplify building websites and web applications.

- **Data science:** Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make data analysis and machine learning efficient.

- **Automation:** Tools like Selenium and RPA can automate repetitive tasks and workflows.

- **System administration:** Scripts can be written to manage servers, configure systems, and automate tasks.

- **Scientific computing:** Libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib facilitate complex mathematical calculations and data visualization.

## What is Flask?

  

[Flask](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fflask.pocoo.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEJ9V-_HcnDs2ho4QdgKcuzcvyZwA) is a web framework. This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website.

  

Flask is part of the categories of the micro-framework. Micro-framework are normally framework with little to no dependencies to external libraries. This has pros and cons. Pros would be that the framework is light, there are little dependency to update and watch for security bugs, cons is that some time you will have to do more work by yourself or increase yourself the list of dependencies by adding plugins.

## Theory Questions

  

Answer the questions in your own words, include any references that you might have used.

  

1. In terms of Python and website development, what is Flask?

2. Research and explain what the Model View Controller design pattern is and how it relates to Flask projects.

1. Use your project as example.

3. Briefly compare and contrast Flask and Django frameworks.
