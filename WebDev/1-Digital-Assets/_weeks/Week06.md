    # Student Competency Worksheets
    
    In Google Classroom, there will be a number of VET Competency Worksheets that apply to recent work (possibly assessments).
    
    These documents are where you competency in tasks are **recorded** as evidence.
    
    For each Competency, there are a number of Performance Criteria.
    
    For each Performance Criteria you will need to enter some form of **evidence.** Follow the instructions.
    
    The evidence could be one or many of the following options:
    
    - Screenshot
    - Photo
    - Explanation (short response / dot points)
    - Etc.
    
    Once entered you‚Äôve entered the evidence,
    
    - Set the completed date to the current date.
    - Set the completion status to ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù
    
    ## Sample Form
    
    The forms are complex, however you only need to focus on a few sections.
    
    Green highlight - Lists the evidence you need to supply.
    
    Blue Highlight - Where you put your evidence.
    
    Yellow Highlight - Mark with the current date and set as complete.

- HTML
    
    # HTML
    
    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language used to create the content and structure of a webpage.

    HTML is made up of Tags.

    # **HTML Tags**
    
    There a a multitude of HTML tags that you can use, here is a small sample.
    
    ![https_lh3.googleusercontent.com-piTjWz-dWaYXBgq27mTdeIAAAAAAAAWJAsfFyTUlnG1oc3ipn0XjAjJOfNYgMiHCMACLkCGAYYCws0Basic-HTML.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/333ef468-b8fe-49c6-a178-b20d272cb75b/https_lh3.googleusercontent.com-piTjWz-dWaYXBgq27mTdeIAAAAAAAAWJAsfFyTUlnG1oc3ipn0XjAjJOfNYgMiHCMACLkCGAYYCws0Basic-HTML.png)
    
    In each of these sections, there are a number of **tags** that make up the sections. Here are some examples.
    
    ![https_lh3.googleusercontent.com-LJRscSdABw8XBgq2zn1bgIAAAAAAAAWJAxMnEbyy0H9Qg7hvFPzC4726O8yeDBZtZQCLkCGAYYCws0HTML.Structure.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/66f8362e-062f-4641-bf2d-a3cfaa986d63/https_lh3.googleusercontent.com-LJRscSdABw8XBgq2zn1bgIAAAAAAAAWJAxMnEbyy0H9Qg7hvFPzC4726O8yeDBZtZQCLkCGAYYCws0HTML.Structure.jpg)
    
    # HTML Example
    
    In Webstorm, when you create a new HTML5 file, the default code is generated. This is a good basic structure for a HTML file. It shows the overall `<html>` tags as well as the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    To practice, this will show how to use some of the more common HTML tags that will be used.
    
    ## Titles - `<title>`
    
    Change the text between the <title> tags to what you want the title to be.
    
    Example: `<title>Ngunnawal Country</title>`
    
    ## Paragraphs - `<p>`
    
    Blocks of text can be defined using the `<p> .. </p>` tag.
    
    Everything between the `<p> .. </p>` will be displayed as a single paragraph.
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <p>
        Orci varius natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Phasellus dolor lorem, lacinia vitae maximus aliquet, tristique at dui. Phasellus quis blandit sapien, eu pellentesque lorem. Donec ac augue in massa ullamcorper faucibus vel ac leo. Morbi vitae eros justo. Etiam ultrices malesuada commodo. Etiam porta fermentum neque vel molestie. Donec pharetra, arcu quis bibendum vestibulum, est velit sollicitudin urna, eu commodo metus risus vitae massa. Duis eros magna, pharetra et diam maximus, commodo pretium dolor. Nam vehicula ultrices lorem non ultricies. Vestibulum magna sapien, volutpat ac magna accumsan, aliquet finibus metus.
    </p>
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 1.39.20 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9e5b5a2b-b4f7-41a0-888d-030819c12d2a/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_1.39.20_pm.png)
    
    ## Images - `<img>`
    
    Images can be included in the HTML. It is best to include the images inside the project, preferably inside a folder/directory. The path to the image file has to match EXACTLY.
    
    <aside> üí° <img> tags are one of the few tags that do not require a close (</img>) tag.
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 1.40.49 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e6f14a62-13df-4d7c-91e3-b2ad13c8c76e/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_1.40.49_pm.png)
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <img src="images/ngunnawalsunset.jpeg">
    ```
    
    ## Links - `<a>`
    
    Links to other HTML pages in the project, or to external website are done through the anchor - `<a>` - tag. As an attribute you need to define the link to the page. You also need to define what text the link appears as between the `<a>` and `</a>` tags.
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    ```
    
    # HTML Layout
    
    HTML can be used to determine the layout of the page in the browser. In ‚ÄúThe Olden Days‚Äù (1990s) the `<table>` tag was used as the primary method for laying out content in the page. The developer could create rows and columns and put content (images or text etc) inside each ‚Äúcell‚Äù.
    
    However this is not the most current or suggested use.
    
    ## Reasons for not using Tables.
    
    - Tables are not accessible (easy to sue for users with additional needs). Screen readers for people with sight issues can not correctly navigate tables and have them read out the content to the user.
    - For complex websites, tables can get very complicated quickly.
    - Slow to Load. The whole table needs to be read by the browser before it can display the content.
    - Inflexible. Different sized screen widths can vastly impact the readability of tables. For example, mobile phones.
    
    The `<div>` tag is your friend.
    
    ## The `<div>` Tag
    
    The `<div>` tag is used to define a section of the website, and is referred to as a **container**. This means that it doesn‚Äôt display information by itself, but holds other information to display. You can include any other tags within `<div>` tags, even other `<div>`s.
    
    <aside> üí° <div> stands for division. As in the tag defines a divsion or section of the website.
    
    </aside>
    
- CSS
    
    # Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to determine _how_ the HTML is displayed in the browser.
    
    CSS is made up of the **Selector** and various **declarations**.
    
    The selector links to the HTML tag, and the declaration is setting a particular property a value. Each declaration has to be ended by a semi-colon - `;`.
    
    ![img_selector.gif](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4adada63-f37c-4d4f-b601-b40982586990/img_selector.gif)
    
    ## Example CSS
    
    This CSS would set all <p> tags to be red, centred text.
    
    ```css
    p {
      color: red;
      text-align: center;
    }
    ```
    
    # How to include CSS in your page/site.
    
    There are three ways to include CSS:
    
    - External CSS
    - Internal CSS, and
    - Inline
    
    Each level of CSS gets more specific as you go from External to Inline.
    
    <aside> üí° It‚Äôs also important to note that CSS is cumulative. Meaning that you can have external, internal and inline css all impacting HTML tags, and all of the CSS declarations will be applied.
    
    </aside>
    
    ## External CSS
    
    External CSS is creating a seperate file to contain site-wide CSS. This is useful because then all pages can have the same CSS. When the CSS is changed in the external file, the whole site is updated.
    
    ### How to - External CSS
    
    In Webstorms, right-click on the project folder, choose New and then Stylesheet.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.35.17 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50438192-28bd-466b-a27f-f3ce3fb12788/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.35.17_pm.png)
    
    Name the file appropriately.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.35.26 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cd03414b-0c1f-4994-aba4-3162c79bff10/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.35.26_pm.png)
    
    Create your first entry with the `h1` selector. Save the file.
    
    <aside> üí° You can set the font-size or many other properties to anything that is possible. This site is good for a start: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.43.41 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/774cef5b-40dc-4d18-9100-0f6c34777985/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.43.41_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```css
        h1 {
            font-size: xxx-large;
        }
        ```
        
    
    Open your HTML file. Update the <head> section to include a link to the CSS file you created. This uses the `<link>` tag.
    
    <aside> üí° The `rel` attribute indicates the type of relationship between the current HTML and the external file being loaded.
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.41.22 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0f1f495a-f109-43fe-93b4-b53ab34dfec3/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.41.22_pm.png)
    
    View the HTML page in your browser. You should notice that any `h1` tags are now show the text larger.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.44.34 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a45bae43-1a9a-4d0b-a434-8cfe7ce885ba/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.44.34_pm.png)
    
    Now that the connection has been made, you can edit the CSS and the page in the browser will update on refresh.
    
    ![2022-04-01 12-46-57.2022-04-01 12_47_35.gif](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0b34e64c-ff52-4a68-a88b-5b55cb21baf4/2022-04-01_12-46-57.2022-04-01_12_47_35.gif)
    
    Update all your HTML files with the same <link> tag in the <head> tag. This will make all pages use the same CSS and assist in making the site more consistent.
    
    ## Internal CSS
    
    Internal CSS is CSS defined in the HTML file. The CSS selectors and declarations are **only** accessible from within that single HTML.
    
    This uses the `<style> ... </style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML.
    
    ### How To - Internal CSS
    
    Within the <head> section, create a `<style> ... </style>` and include the CSS that you want.
    
    <aside> üí° The syntax for Internal CSS is exactly the same as External CSS.
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.52.19 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7f507bcf-4837-4e81-a0a4-07a82946c7bc/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.52.19_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```html
        <style>
                h2 {
                    color:blue;
                }
        </style>
        ```
        
    
    Load the page in the browser and you should see the changes made to the `<h2>` tag.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.53.20 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e814606c-ddd4-4f35-9b3a-59cbbf3ccc31/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.53.20_pm.png)
    
    ## Inline CSS
    
    Inline CSS impacts only one HTML tag. This is used if you wish to change the way only one tag is displayed, and not the other sections of the HTML of the same tag. There are other ways to do this as well, but for simple changes, this can be very effective.
    
    Find the tag you want to update and add a style attribute in the opening tag. Inside the quotes, enter the CSS you wish.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-01 at 12.56.25 pm.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0892f469-d59a-4731-8d1b-87e230bdbf33/Screen_Shot_2022-04-01_at_12.56.25_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```css
        style="color:green;"
        ```
        
    
    Load the page in the browser, and you‚Äôll notice that only one paragraph (in this case) has been changed to green.
