# What is an E Course?

An[ E Course](https://www.bsss.act.edu.au/act_senior_secondary_system/curriculum/e_courses) focuses on the delivery and completion of Vocational Competencies, without the BSSS requirements of attendance and assessment.
Students studying this course will **not** receive an A-E grade, as the only focus is the competencies.
Students will receive points towards their Year 12 Senior Secondary Certificate upon completion of the 2 year course. The exact number of points depends on the competencies *achieved*.
