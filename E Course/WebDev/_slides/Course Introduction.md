# Development Environment

Code either 
- **online** (`GitHub Codespaces`) with a chromebook
- **locally** (`VSCode` & `Docker`) with a full OS device.

note:
Coding online with Codespaces can be done on any device - chromebook as well - however can be slow and occasionally time out
Coding with a PC/laptop is more setup time, but is faster.
"Full OS device" means desktop or laptop computer. Not a chromebook.
