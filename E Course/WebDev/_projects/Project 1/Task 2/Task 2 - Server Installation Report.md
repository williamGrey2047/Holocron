# Task

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Create a Google Sheet, named "Server Option Comparison".

Include data on the cost of building a server to run multiple websites, through Docker and having a dedicated server. Using research, find the costs for appropriate hardware:
- CPU
- Memory
- Local Storage (HDD/SSD)
- Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor
- etc.

Using formulas, calculate the total sum of each servers.


Include the spreadsheet created as a 'live' link in your Google Doc report.
=======
Write report detailing the installation of the server, specifically for the project requirements and goals. 

Associated with the report, you will also create a timesheet spreadsheet to document the hours and cost to the client. This spreadsheet is to be embedded/linked into the Google Doc.

## Deliverables

Both deliverables need to be submitted in their original format (e.g. Google Docs, Google Sheets) **and** as a PDF.

1. Word Processed Report
2. Timesheet Spreadsheet
