# Evaluation Checklist

# Evaluation Checklist

For the project you will need to design the Project Goals. These will be used as the categories which you'll evaluate the project against towards the end of the project. You can also think of these as Success Criteria or Evaluation Criteria. 

**Be as specific as possible.**

For instance,

1. The project runs independently.
2. The project doesn’t produce any errors to the user.
3. The project doesn’t produce any errors, visible to the developer.

Use the project goals and objectives to guide this list.

Here is an example from an assessment from a previous year.

On the left, there is a list of **goals**, as headings. The **notes** column on the right lists the details under which that goal will be evaluated, or the details of what that Goal covers. The **status** column is one that would have been filled out at the end of the project.

You could produce a diagram such as this one, **or similar**, or you can present it as a table in a Word Processed document.  The exact format of the Goals is less important than your analysis of the *entire* project and how you and the group will determine success, or levels of success.

‼️ It is **not** expected that you evaluate the project at until after development has completed. These are simply the topics that you ***will*** evaluate the project against.
