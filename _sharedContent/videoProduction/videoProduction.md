# Exporting the video

The steps to export the video depend greatly on the software used. Check resources online on how to export if you’re unsure.

A few things to consider:

- Export in a common format (e.g. MP4)
- Set the resolution to the highest available.
- Allow for enough time to save the video

**Check the video after exporting to ensure it saved correctly.**
