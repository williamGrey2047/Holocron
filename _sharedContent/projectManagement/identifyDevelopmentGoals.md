# Development Goals

<aside>
‼️ This may be done individually, or as a group, depending on the nature of the project.

</aside>

For this task, use Notion. This can be used as a Project Management tool to keep track of different jobs, indicating which ones are outstanding, which are completed, which are waiting for others to complete.

Tasks can be assigned to one or more people as well.

> [!tip] If you’re working in a group, you will be invited to the specific board.


## Identify Milestone Dates

Document any important dates set by the project (due dates etc).

Identify and document any milestone dates needed by the project. For example, when the first version should be finished.

## Identify Development Goals

- Create a list of all the goals that the system needs to achieve
    - Use analysis and/or design to assist (if applicable)
- Start with a ‘brain dump’ of all the tasks.
- Focus on the end goal of each piece of functionality.
    - For example: A high score system: A High Score system which stores the top 10 scores for a game, saving the data to a cloud server. The game retrieves the latest high score system each time the game loads.

## Group Goals

Using the list of goals, group them by tasks.

For instance, all web functionality can be grouped under “Website”

## “Stage” the tasks.

Break each task into smaller steps.

For instance, if the task was “Create Administrative access to all website functions, plus administrator functionality”. This could be broken into various steps:

1. Create administrator account
2. Identify Administrator login with separate profile page.
3. Add Administrator functionality.

Link these stages with the milestones identify earlier. For example, the project may need administrator login with profile page is acceptable for version 1 of the project, and the administrator functionality is set for Version 2.

## Due Dates

Add due dates (if any) for specific tasks.

## Prioritise

Assign priorities for each group. Start with Priority 1 (being the most important), 2 and 3.

Under each group, assign priorities to the functions or tasks.

<aside>
‼️ It’s ok to have multiple tasks with the same priorities.

## Assign to a person (if applicable)

If working in a group, assign people to the different groups and tasks.
