# Development Log

At regular intervals (check the requirements) you will be updating a development log to demonstrate how the project has developed from its infancy to completion.

<aside>
⁉️ The format of the log is up to you. It could be a video series, a website, a google doc.

</aside>

In each entry, you are to cover topics such as the ones shown.. Choose any and all that apply. You can add sections if needed or if appropriate.

Make the devlog visual by including:

- screenshots
- videos/gifs of the project in its current state
- Code snippets

Explain each of these.

Focus on the *improvements* you’ve made to the project. 

<aside>
‼️ You could show before and after versions of the project to demonstrate what and how the project has been improved.

</aside>

Some of the topics you *could* cover are:

- Code updates
    - Discussion of the improvements in code functionality or structure
- Project (non-code) Updates
    - Discussion of the improvements in the non code aspects of the Project
- Back-log items
    - items that have been put on the back-burner due to time, technical, or other limitations
    - Items that have been taken off the back-log
- Outstanding issues
    - Sorted by Priority
- Any other items.

To evaluate your process, you could discuss the different options you could have taken and why you chose the one you did.
