# Remote Development Plan

In an existing, or new Google Doc, document your plan for how the project will continue if there is a period of remote work.

Consider the following questions:

1. How will you continue the development process?
2. What parts of the project can you focus on at home? 
3. What would you **not** be able to do at home.
4. What hardware would you need?
5. What software would you need?
6. What other project files would you need?
7. What would limit your progress?
8. Are there any show-stopping issues? Issues that will **need** to be resolved before work can commence/continue.

<aside>
‼️  Even document aspects that have already been ‘solved’ such as having a computer at home with the required software.

There will need to be a few cases to consider:

- You are working remotely.
- Your teacher is working remotely
- Other members of the project team are working remotely
- Everyone is working remotely.

Document a plan for all of these cases.
