> [!info]- Project Overview
> Welcome to this tutorial on building a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game using Godot
>   This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of creating an FPS game from scratch, providing step-by-step instructions and explanations along the way.  
>   
>   Godot is a powerful, open-source game engine that is highly flexible and customisable, making it an excellent choice for game development.   
>   It supports a variety of platforms and offers a unique and intuitive scene system.    
>   
>   In this tutorial, we will cover key aspects of game development such as setting up the player character, implementing movement and shooting mechanics, creating enemies, and designing levels.   
>   
>   We will also delve into more advanced topics such as raycasting and scripting.    
>   By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional FPS game that you can further customise and expand upon.  
>   
>   These instructions are written for Godot v4.2.2

> 	- This week we will begin working through a VET Competency as well as working on Assessment documentation and the finishing touches of your games. You should aim to have this competency fully complete at the end of Week 10. Completing the competency is really simple and just takes a bit of time. Jacob will be going over how to complete the competency in great detail in Mondays class.

> 	- You should be able to access the feedback on your development process section now. Review these and have a look at the feedback.
> 	- The assessment documentation scaffold page has been populated for each section now. These should make it very easy to write up your assessment well before the due date. The whole document is due in week 12. With 3 weeks left (not including the school holidays) you have plenty of time to work through the linked page and write up your assessment documentation.
> #### Theory
> N/A
> #### Practical
> There is no coding content assigned for this week. However any further development you make on your project will only assist in the writing of your assessment as you'll have more content to discuss in your technical report. If you have completed the VET Competency and are up to date on your assessment try to independently find something that you could complete and work towards it. If you come up with any others be sure to let Jacob or Ryan know, show us what you made and how you made it. Here are some suggestions:
> - An additional level
> - A boss enemy that spawns once all enemies are defeated
> - Different kinds of bullets (perhaps a slow moving bullet that does more less damage but tracks towards enemies)
> - Different win/loss conditions
> - A level where you have no weapon but have to collect items in a time frame while dodging enemies.
