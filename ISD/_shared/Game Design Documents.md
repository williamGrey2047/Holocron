Game Design Documents (GDDs) are specifications that describe the design and key features of a video game. They help the game development team understand the vision for the game and stay organised throughout the creation process.

A GDD typically includes sections that outline the game's concept, setting, gameplay, mechanics, story, characters, objects, levels, and technical requirements. It may contain concept art, flowcharts, mockups, and other diagrams to visually communicate ideas. The level of detail in a GDD depends on the scope and complexity of the game. Larger design teams will often have multiple specialised GDDs for different aspects of the game (e.g. combat, missions).

Well-written GDDs are essential for keeping the team on the same page, estimating realistic timelines and budgets, and maintaining a consistent creative vision. They are living documents that are updated as the game evolves. GDDs help prevent miscommunications and minimise wasted effort, ultimately resulting in a better final product.

# What is a Game Design Document (GDD)?

> [!info] A game design document (GDD) is a software design document that serves as a ***blueprint from which your game is to be built***. It helps you define the scope of your game and sets the general direction for the project, keeping the entire team on the same page.

# How to write a GDD

Consider the game you wish to make, within the requirements specification (for instance a game based on Space Invaders). 

Consider what the players purpose will be (e.g. collect all the coins).

Consider the enemy’s purpose (e.g. kill the player)

Craft the narrative of the game based on this interaction and then add more detail to “round out” the story.

## Images

Use images in your game design document (GDD). As visual media, games benefit from visual documentation. Including images in your GDD will make the design more clear and compelling.

Sketch ideas, for instance the interface or environment. 

To include internet-sourced images, cite your references.

You can sketch on paper, take a photo of it and include the photo in the document.

## GDD Sections

This table gives hints or questions on what to include for each of the headings. Some sections may not appear in the GDD template you’ve been provided.

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Summary** | Sum up your game idea in 2 sentences. A kind of elevator pitch. Keep it simple! |
| **Gameplay** | What should the gameplay be like? What is the goal of the game, and what kind of obstacles are in the way? What tactics should the player use to overcome them? |
| **Mindset** | What kind of mindset do you want to provoke in the player? Do you want them to feel powerful, or weak? Adventurous, or nervous? Hurried, or calm? How do you intend to provoke those emotions? |
| **Map** | Include a sketch of the level map/s. |
| **Screens** | What ‘screens’ will the user see? Title Scene, Main Game, win scene, lose scene, options etc. Quick description of each. Also include sketch of the HUD (Heads Up Display) |
| **Controls** | How will the player interact with the game? Will they be able to choose the controls? What kind of in-game events are they going to be able to trigger, and how? (e.g. pressing buttons, opening doors, etc.) |
| **Game Flow** | The typical play through - Player starts in forest → Pond to the left, must move right → To the right is a hill, the player jumps to traverse it (“jump” taught) etc. Written from the player's Perspective. |
| **Graphics Style Attributes** | [https://www.notion.so/ryancather/Assessment-1-Pitch-Due-899fae5e4e64400fb3a231a5d177c954](Assessment%201%20-%20Pitch%20-%20Due%20899fae5e4e64400fb3a231a5d177c954.md) |
| **Graphics Needed** | What 2d graphics are needed? Menu graphics, other UI elements? What 3d Models are needed? Consider player, environment, objects etc. Examples/Samples of all of these?  |
| **Style Attributes** | Consistency is key. Define that consistency here. What kind of instruments do you want to use in your music? Any particular tempo, key? Influences, genre? Mood? Stylistically, what kind of sound effects are you looking for? Do you want to exaggerate actions with lengthy, cartoony sounds (e.g. mario’s jump), or use just enough to let the player know something happened (e.g. mega man’s landing)? Going for realism? You can use the music style as a bit of a reference too. Remember, auditory feedback should stand out from the music and other sound effects so the player hears it well. Volume, panning, and frequency/pitch are all important aspects to consider in both music *and* sounds - so plan accordingly! |
| **Sounds Needed** | Background music, sound effects (door opening, points etc). Examples/Samples of these. |
